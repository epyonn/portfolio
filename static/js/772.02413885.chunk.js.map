I observed that these incidents often occurred in specific streets or locations. This realization sparked the idea for an app where users can collate data on break-in hotspots and visualize them on a map. This feature aims to assist users in identifying and opting for safer parking spots based on the compiled data. As a full-stack CRUD application, Crime Compass leverages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front end, while employing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. It's a community-driven platform, accessible online, where anyone can contribute by reporting incidents, thereby helping others make informed decisions about where to park safely.            \n                </Typography>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default CrimeCompass","import React from 'react';\nimport '../../styles/Projects.css';\n\ntype VideoPlayerProps = {\n    videoPath: string;\n    width: string;\n    height: string;\n};\n\nconst ProjectVideo: React.FC<VideoPlayerProps> = ({ videoPath, width, height }) => {\n    return (\n        <img src={videoPath} alt=\"Animated content\" width={width} height={height} className=\"project-gif\"/>\n    );\n};\n\n\nexport default ProjectVideo;"],"names":["CrimeCompass","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","Typography","ProjectVideo","videoPath","crimeGif","width","height","_ref","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
