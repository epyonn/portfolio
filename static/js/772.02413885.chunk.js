I observed that these incidents often occurred in specific streets or locations. This realization sparked the idea for an app where users can collate data on break-in hotspots and visualize them on a map. This feature aims to assist users in identifying and opting for safer parking spots based on the compiled data. As a full-stack CRUD application, Crime Compass leverages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front end, while employing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. It's a community-driven platform, accessible online, where anyone can contribute by reporting incidents, thereby helping others make informed decisions about where to park safely."})})]})},2805:(e,a,i)=>{i.d(a,{Z:()=>t});i(2791),i(9886);var s=i(184);const t=e=>{let{videoPath:a,width:i,height:t}=e;return(0,s.jsx)("img",{src:a,alt:"Animated content",width:i,height:t,className:"project-gif"})}}}]);
